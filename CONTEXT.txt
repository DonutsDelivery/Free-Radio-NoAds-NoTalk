KDE PLASMA WIDGET DEVELOPMENT - CONTEXT AND STATUS
==================================================

PROJECT: RadCap Radio Widget
LOCATION: /home/user/Documents/Free-Radio-NoAds-NoTalk/radcapradio/

CURRENT STATUS:
==============
- Widget has been modified with new features but changes aren't visible after reinstallation
- Testing with red background color to verify if reinstallation process works
- Plasma restart/refresh issues preventing updated widget from loading

CHANGES MADE TO WIDGET:
======================
1. âœ… SOMAFM INTEGRATION:
   - Added 30 SomaFM stations to radiodata.js as first category "SOMA FM"
   - Modified main.qml loadSources() function to separate SomaFM as own top menu item
   - Added SomaFM-specific URL handling in getStreamUrl() function
   - Added fetchSomaFMMetadata() function for SomaFM API song info

2. âœ… BETTER BORDERS:
   - Added subtle borders to all Rectangle UI elements
   - Used Qt.rgba() with 0.2-0.3 opacity for visibility
   - Added antialiasing: true for smooth rounded corners
   - Added main wrapper Rectangle with red background (for testing)

3. âœ… UI HEADER:
   - Added header Rectangle with "ðŸ“» RadCap Radio" title
   - Styled with highlight color and proper typography

4. âœ… SYNTAX FIXES:
   - Fixed missing closing braces in QML structure
   - Widget should load without syntax errors

INSTALLATION PROCESS DISCOVERED:
================================
CORRECT METHOD:
- Location: ~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/radcapradio/
- Command: kpackagetool6 --type="Plasma/Applet" --install radcapradio
- NOT: kpackagetool6 --install (missing type parameter)
- NOT: ~/.local/share/kpackage/generic/ (wrong location)

CACHE CLEARING NEEDED:
- rm -rf ~/.cache/plasma-qmlcache
- rm -rf ~/.cache/plasmashell
- kbuildsycoca6 --noincremental

PLASMA RESTART REQUIRED:
- pkill -f plasmashell (force kill all processes)
- Let Plasma auto-restart to pick up new files

CURRENT ISSUE:
=============
- Widget files are correctly installed with changes
- grep shows red color is in installed main.qml
- But widget instances on desktop still show old version
- Plasma restart not properly refreshing widget instances

FILES TO CHECK AFTER RESTART:
============================
1. Widget should show RED BACKGROUND (test feature)
2. Widget should show header "ðŸ“» RadCap Radio" 
3. Top menu should have separate "ðŸŽµ SomaFM" item
4. All borders should be visible and subtle

WORKING REINSTALL SCRIPT:
========================
/home/user/Documents/Free-Radio-NoAds-NoTalk/auto_reinstall.sh

NEXT STEPS AFTER PC RESTART:
============================
1. Verify if widget shows red background and header
2. If yes: Remove red background, keep improvements
3. If no: Debug why Plasma cache isn't clearing properly
4. Test SomaFM stations and metadata fetching
5. Verify all border improvements are visible

KEY LESSON LEARNED:
==================
- Use --upgrade for existing widgets, --install for new
- Must use --type="Plasma/Applet" parameter
- Plasma caching is aggressive, requires force restart
- Widget instances don't auto-refresh, need Plasma restart
