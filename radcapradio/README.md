# RadCap Radio Plasma Widget

This widget targets **KDE Plasma 6** and lists radio genres from **radcap.ru**.
Selecting a genre loads the radio channels for that category. Clicking a channel
starts streaming with play/stop and volume controls always available at the
bottom of the widget.

The widget retrieves the HTML pages from `radcap.ru` and extracts links ending in
`m3u`, `pls` or `xspf`. These links are used as the stream source for playback.

## Installation

1. Run `kpackagetool6 --install radcapradio` from this repository root.
2. Add "RadCap Radio" from the Plasma widget list.

### Packaging as `.plasmoid`

To distribute the widget as a single archive run:

```bash
zip -r RadCapRadio.plasmoid radcapradio
```

You can then doubleâ€‘click the resulting file to install it in Plasma 6.
