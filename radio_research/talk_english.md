## Notes on Stream URLs

### Format Types:
- **MP3/AAC direct URLs**: Work directly in most media players (VLC, MPD, etc.)
- **PLS/M3U files**: Playlist files that contain the actual stream URL - recommended for stability
- **M3U8 (HLS)**: Adaptive streaming format used by many modern broadcasters - requires HLS-compatible player

### Tips for Using These Streams:
1. PLS and M3U playlist files are preferred as the actual stream servers may change
2. Some streams may be geo-restricted (especially BBC from certain regions)
3. HLS streams (m3u8) work well in VLC and modern players but not in older software
4. Always verify stream URLs as they may change over time

### Verification Status:
These URLs were researched in January 2026. Stream URLs can change, so verify before adding to production systems.
